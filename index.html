            <h3>NFT is a non-fungible token. It is popular in the world while now. It cannot be copied or subdivided. First of all, NFT is more valuable because it’s the original one. We can think like this. Many Mona Lisa pictures are not higher in price but the original Mona Lisa picture drawn by Leonardo DaVinci is the world’s highest picture. Like that NFT has its privacy! Only 1 has one like that! To buy NFTs s there are many places.
                Ex: Opensea
                      Foundation

            <h3>NFT creation is not only designing it has coding also! It is not simple It is very complex! You want to create all objects into a separate layer and combined those from programming! It’s huge progress! I think you would try it and get some dollars to Sri Lanka and help to solve problems in Sri Lanka</h3>
